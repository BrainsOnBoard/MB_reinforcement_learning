Mushroom body models of temporal difference learning.

To run the MB TD model, the generic command is:
q = mb_td(SEED,GAMMA,NTRIALS,NT,DISCOUNT,EPSKM);

Additional optional arguments can be included (from line 52 onwards in mb_mv_td.m to see which options are available).

Example usage:

q = mb_td(1,1,100,[],0.9,10^-1.8,'memsave',false);

Notes:
Don't use 
q = ........'memsave',true); 
as it is buggy!
